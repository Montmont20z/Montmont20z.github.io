            <p>Organizer, Lim Kang Yew, opened restaurant 'PLS EAT' in February 2010 at Jalan Genting Kelang, Setapak.<br>
            PLS EAT's development has been enlivened with the energy to cook and serve solid, Traditional Chinese food. 
            Another special feature of our restaurant is that we prepare additional daily dishes from time to time, 
            giving our customers a surprising experience every time.<br><br>

            In contrast to other Chinese eateries, PLS EAT was made with <br>the explicit expectation to appear as something else.
        <br>We've been well known for gathering people, including families, children<br>
         and senior citizens until the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.<br>
         In order to preserve our brand and strive, and for good friends <br>to remember the taste so we can reunite again,
         we developed this website.<br><br> 
         
         This website has not only helped us through difficult times during lockdown, 
         it has truly <br>improved the sales and efficiency of our store. We use this website for both online pre-order and dine-in. 
         <br>Now people can not only order food online at home 
         which further reach out to other communities, <br>allowing more people to join our family.
         This also allows us to take care of more customers<br> at the same time, 
         allow customers to enjoy food faster, improving the overall experience. </p>
